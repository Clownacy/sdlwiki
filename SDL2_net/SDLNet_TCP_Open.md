###### (This function is part of SDL_net, a separate library from SDL.)
# SDLNet_TCP_Open

Open a TCP network socket.

## Header File

Defined in [<SDL_net.h>](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL_net/blob/SDL2/include/SDL_net.h)

## Syntax

```c
TCPsocket SDLNet_TCP_Open(IPaddress *ip);
```

## Function Parameters

|             |        |                                                               |
| ----------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| IPaddress * | **ip** | The address to open a connection to (or to host a server on). |

## Return Value

(TCPsocket) Returns the newly created socket, or NULL if there was an
error.

## Remarks

If `ip->host` is INADDR_NONE or INADDR_ANY, this creates a local server
socket on the given port, otherwise a TCP connection to the remote host and
port is attempted. The address passed in should already be swapped to
network byte order (addresses returned from
[SDLNet_ResolveHost](SDLNet_ResolveHost)() are already in the correct
form).

## Version

This function is available since SDL_net 2.0.0.
