# SDL_RaiseWindow

Request that a window be raised above other windows and gain the input focus.

## Header File

Defined in [<SDL3/SDL_video.h>](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/blob/main/include/SDL3/SDL_video.h)

## Syntax

```c
SDL_bool SDL_RaiseWindow(SDL_Window *window);
```

## Function Parameters

|                            |            |                      |
| -------------------------- | ---------- | -------------------- |
| [SDL_Window](SDL_Window) * | **window** | the window to raise. |

## Return Value

([SDL_bool](SDL_bool)) Returns [SDL_TRUE](SDL_TRUE) on success or
[SDL_FALSE](SDL_FALSE) on failure; call [SDL_GetError](SDL_GetError)() for
more information.

## Remarks

The result of this request is subject to desktop window manager policy,
particularly if raising the requested window would result in stealing focus
from another application. If the window is successfully raised and gains
input focus, an
[SDL_EVENT_WINDOW_FOCUS_GAINED](SDL_EVENT_WINDOW_FOCUS_GAINED) event will
be emitted, and the window will have the
[SDL_WINDOW_INPUT_FOCUS](SDL_WINDOW_INPUT_FOCUS) flag set.

## Version

This function is available since SDL 3.0.0.
