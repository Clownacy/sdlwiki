# SDL_SetAudioStreamGain

Change the gain of an audio stream.

## Header File

Defined in [<SDL3/SDL_audio.h>](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/blob/main/include/SDL3/SDL_audio.h)

## Syntax

```c
SDL_bool SDL_SetAudioStreamGain(SDL_AudioStream *stream, float gain);
```

## Function Parameters

|                                      |            |                                                |
| ------------------------------------ | ---------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| [SDL_AudioStream](SDL_AudioStream) * | **stream** | the stream on which the gain is being changed. |
| float                                | **gain**   | the gain. 1.0f is no change, 0.0f is silence.  |

## Return Value

([SDL_bool](SDL_bool)) Returns [SDL_TRUE](SDL_TRUE) on success or
[SDL_FALSE](SDL_FALSE) on failure; call [SDL_GetError](SDL_GetError)() for
more information.

## Remarks

The gain of a stream is its volume; a larger gain means a louder output,
with a gain of zero being silence.

Audio streams default to a gain of 1.0f (no change in output).

This is applied during [SDL_GetAudioStreamData](SDL_GetAudioStreamData),
and can be continuously changed to create various effects.

## Thread Safety

It is safe to call this function from any thread, as it holds a
stream-specific mutex while running.

## Version

This function is available since SDL 3.0.0.
