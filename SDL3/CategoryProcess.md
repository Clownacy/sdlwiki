# CategoryProcess

Process control support.

These functions provide a cross-platform way to spawn and manage OS-level
processes.

You can create a new subprocess with
[SDL_CreateProcess](SDL_CreateProcess)() and optionally read and write to
it using [SDL_ReadProcess](SDL_ReadProcess)() and
[SDL_WriteProcess](SDL_WriteProcess)(). If more advanced functionality like
chaining input between processes is necessary, you can use
[SDL_CreateProcessWithProperties](SDL_CreateProcessWithProperties)().

You can get the status of a created process with
[SDL_WaitProcess](SDL_WaitProcess)(), or terminate the process with
[SDL_KillProcess](SDL_KillProcess)().

Don't forget to call [SDL_DestroyProcess](SDL_DestroyProcess)() to clean
up, whether the process process was killed, terminated on its own, or is
still running!
